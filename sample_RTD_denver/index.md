## RTD Rolling Assets Technical Break Down and Operational Data Set

[_Gemechisa.ayana@rtd-denver.com_](mailto:Gemechisa.ayana@rtd-denver.com)

_07/09/2018_

The data set is for fleets break downs (technical symptom cause) and operational customers count on a route and trip level. There are five types of data set of breakdown and operational trip information

1. **Break down information** – Has the duration of the breakdown, on the route name, date time stamp with the technical symptom codes. (Fleets technical breakdown0117to0618.csv)

    **Meta Data**
    
    The provided data set for Break down information is from Q1 2017 to Q2, 2018 and has 5,354 rows.
